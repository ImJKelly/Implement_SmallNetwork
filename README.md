<h2>Description</h2>
The lab demonstrates an ability to design a small network, subnet the network, implement VLANs, configure Cisco devices, and ensure connectivity. 
The lab is an assignment for CSIS 331 (Networking), and was completed using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
An addressing table needed completed, a network topology needed created, devices needed configured, and connectivity needed verified for this lab.
Screenshots of the addressing table, network topology, connectivity between devices, and completion percentage are provided.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
